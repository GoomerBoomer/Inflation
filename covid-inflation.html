    <p class="covid-paragraph" style="color:white;">In this graph it shows that inflation was at an all time low then lockdown increased inflation up to 7% in 2022. During the Covid period the economy was in distress and people didn't have money due to them losing their jobs because of restrictions from practices to evade catching the virus. So the unemplyed would recieve money from the government as E.I. (Employment Insurance) huge amounts too, up to $27 billion to workers and businesses. Other ways Covid would affect inflation negatively was the disruption in global suppy chains especially in Chinna and Asia. When there was demand for supply the management of supply chains were broken. Products saw huge inflated prices in transportation since there was no real system for manufactured goods.</p>
