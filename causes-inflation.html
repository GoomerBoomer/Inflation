  <p style="color:white;"> There are many factors that can contribute to inflation, but the most common cause is an increase in the supply of money without a corresponding increase in the supply of goods and services. When there is too much money in circulation, people and businesses have more money to spend, but there are still the same amount of goods and services available for purchase. This causes an increase in demand, which in turn drives up prices. In addition to the increase in money supply, inflation can also be caused by other factors such as a decrease in the supply of goods and services, an increase in the cost of production, or a decrease in the value of a country's currency. However, the most common cause of inflation is an increase in the money supply relative to the available goods and services.</p>
  
  <h3 style="color:white;">For example, a 5% inflation rate means that the cost of goods has increased by 5% over a period of time</h3>
