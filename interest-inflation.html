           <h3>Description of graph </h3>
            <h5>As we can see the graph above, in 2019, <u style="color: aquamarine;"> The Interest rates </u>for mortgages were higher than the inflation rates but when the interest rates were steady, the inflation rates increased by 2021. This means that the products in 2021 were getting expensive compared to the ones in 2019, so to balance the rates the interest rates stayed steady while making houses cheaper and the goods in market more expensive. While the inflation rates were increasing, the mortgage rates increased too during the period of 2021 to 2022, which lead to huge crisis back in the day, since everything was getting expensive, and people had minimum wages to handle their household. To make the rates balance again, by the start of 2022 the inflation rates started dropping gradually and the interest rates for the houses started to increase.  As we can see now in 2023, houses are expensive compared to the inflation rates of goods. </h5>

            <h3>How are Inflation rates connected to interest rates!</h3>
               <p>The interest rate is the amount a lender charges a borrower (usually money) and is a percentage of the principal,the amount loaned. Inflation and interest rates tend to move in the same direction because interest rates are the primary tool used by the Federal Reserve, the Canada’s central bank, to manage inflation. Since 2012, the Federal Reserve has targeted annual inflation of 2%. For Example, if we want to take loan, we want the Interest rate to be low. In this case, the Interest rate is the amount of money you must pay back with the actual money in loan you borrowed. The faster you pay back money, the better. The interest rate will double each year until you pay back the money. On the other hand, if you want to save money, then the high interest rate means you can earn more on your savings. (Since there are high interest rates people will spend less money and not buy loans). When the central banks raise interest rates, they try to control inflation. A rise in interest rates from a central bank means that a commercial bank will earn more on their reserves(savings). They might make more from keeping their money in a central bank than lending it out. If they do lend it out, they’ll raise their interest rates to decrease the inflation rates. In conclusion, the rates differ in terms of increasing and decreasing over time to balance the economy. </p>
