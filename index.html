  <h3>How Inflation Works and What Can Be Done About Rising Prices</h3>

  <p class="intro-paragraph"><u style="color: rgb(249, 96, 0);">Inflation</u> measures the increase in the cost of goods and services over a given period, usually a year. The unit used to measure Inflation is percentage (%). It can be caused when there is more money in the economy than goods to spend on, in other words, when people have more money, their demand for products and services can rise, and that can pull up prices. The most well-known indicator of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of the average change in prices over time in a fixed market basket of goods and services, in other words, a higher CPI indicates higher inflation, while a falling CPI indicates lower inflation, or even deflation. For example, If the Price of bread increases in the market basket, it indicates that the inflation rates will increase. Once an increase in bread prices happens, the other goods would eventually cost more the next time you buy it. Gradually, the prices rise in the market and almost everything will cost more.</p>
